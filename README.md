## What ?

Simply put: Brackette is a website that allows you to send Challonge matches to individual video game setups (like maybe have an iPad on each setup) to make it easier for players to report their match.

### Alpha

The first ever version of Brackette can be found here, it is very bare bones but shows the potential of what can be done. Brackette Alpha however is a dedicated website with a MySQL Database that now allows for user account creation, creation of Challonge rooms and more. That is why it is an Alpha, it is an extension of the first prototype and will continue to grow.
